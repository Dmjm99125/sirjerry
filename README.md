# Project

This is a Vite + React + TypeScript project scaffolded from a starter template. It includes shadcn-ui components and Tailwind CSS.

Getting started:

1. Install Node.js (recommended via nvm).
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`.

The repository was initially created with a cloud editor. All references to that service have been removed.

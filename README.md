## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Body Parts
1. **Update data file** (`src/data/bodyParts.ts`)
   ```typescript
   {
     id: "new-part",
     name: "New Part",
     x: 50, // X position (0-100%)
     y: 50, // Y position (0-100%)
     emoji: "🆕",
     description: "Educational description for kids",
     funFact: "Interesting fact about this body part!"
   }
   ```

2. **Update game filters** in component files to include the new part

### Customizing Game Difficulty
- Modify the `distance < 15` threshold in QuizMode for click accuracy
- Adjust the number of body parts included in each game mode
- Change timing delays between questions/interactions

### Styling Customization
- Modify Tailwind classes in component files
- Update custom CSS animations in `src/index.css`
- Customize color themes in `tailwind.config.ts`

## 🧪 Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React functional component patterns
- Use descriptive variable names suitable for educational content
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep components focused on single responsibilities

### Adding New Game Modes
1. Create new component in `src/components/`
2. Add to game menu in `GameMenu.tsx`
3. Include routing in main `Index.tsx`
4. Follow existing patterns for state management and UI consistency

### Testing Considerations
- Test on different screen sizes (tablets are primary target)
- Verify audio functionality across browsers
- Check clickable area accuracy with actual children
- Ensure smooth performance on lower-end devices

## 🚀 Deployment

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Deployment Platforms
- **Netlify** - Drag and drop the `dist` folder
- **Vercel** - Connect GitHub repository for automatic deployments
- **GitHub Pages** - Use the build output for static hosting

## 🤝 Contributing

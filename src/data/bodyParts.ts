/**
 * Body Parts Data - Educational Content for Kids
 * 
 * This file contains all the body parts data used throughout the educational games.
 * Each body part includes position coordinates, descriptions, and fun facts designed
 * for kindergarten-age children (4-7 years old).
 * 
 * COORDINATE SYSTEM:
 * - x: Horizontal position (0 = far left, 100 = far right)
 * - y: Vertical position (0 = top, 100 = bottom)
 * - Coordinates are percentages relative to the character image
 * 
 * DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
 * - Left/right body parts are separated for bilateral awareness
 * - Descriptions use simple, kid-friendly language
 * - Fun facts encourage curiosity and learning
 * - Emojis make the interface visually appealing

 * ORGANIZATION:
 * - Head & facial features (top section)

 * 
 * POSITIONING STRATEGY:
 * - Center parts (head, nose, mouth, etc.): x = 50%
 * - Left parts: x = 15-45%
 * - Right parts: x = 55-85%
 * - Y coordinates follow anatomical top-to-bottom order
